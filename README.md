The GeoShapes Java Project is a comprehensive application that demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, simple algorithms, and graphical user interface (GUI) implementation while focusing on geometric shapes and calculations. This project provides a platform for performing various geometric calculations on shapes and visualizing the results through a user-friendly GUI.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design:** The project employs a robust object-oriented design to model different geometric shapes as classes, making it easy to add new shapes in the future.

- **Geometric Calculations:** Perform a range of geometric calculations such as area, perimeter, and more for different shapes including circles, rectangles, and triangles.

- **GUI Interface:** The project features a graphical user interface built with JavaFX, providing an intuitive and interactive way to input shape parameters, view calculations, and visualize the shapes.

- **Simple Algorithms:** Explore simple algorithms used in geometric calculations, enhancing your understanding of fundamental programming concepts.
